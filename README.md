In this project, the coder will practice 
using the useEffect hook by fixing mistakes
in a Todo list application built with React.
The application allows users to manage their
todos by adding, deleting, and clearing them.
By addressing the identified mistakes,
the coder will gain hands-on experience
with the useState and useEffect hooks

Mistake 1: Incorrect function name
Fix: Rename the function from addTodo
to handleAddTodo.

Mistake 2: Missing dependency array
Fix: Add an empty dependency array ([])
as the second argument of useEffect to
ensure it runs only once when the
component mounts.

Mistake 3: Incorrect usage of useState
Fix: Update the clearTodos function to
use the functional form of the state setter.

Mistake 4: Missing functional update.
Fix: To fix this mistake, you should use
the functional form of setTodos to ensure
that you're updating the state correctly.

Mistake 5: Incorrect prop name
Fix: Change the prop name onChan to 
onChange in the input element.

Mistake 6: Incorrect event handler
Fix: Correct the event handler in the
input element to use onChange properly.

Mistake 7: Missing key prop
Fix: Add a unique key prop to the <li> 
element in the map function. You can use
the index as the key.

Mistake 8: Incorrect prop name
Fix: Correct the prop name onClick in
the clear button to clearTodos.
